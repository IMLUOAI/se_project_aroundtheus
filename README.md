**Intro**
key knowledge points:
  
- BEM: BLOCK-ELEMENT-MODIFY
- DOM: DOCUMENT-OBJECT-MODEL
- OOP: OBJECT-ORIENTED-PROGRAMMING (1. Encapsulation 2. Inheritance 3. Polymorphism)
- NPM: NODE PACKAGE MANAGE

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**vectors**
This project's avatar, header\_\_logo, edit-button, plus-button, and heart-button are .svg format which were downloaded from our Figma.

**images**

This project's card pictures are using jpg format which were downloaded from Unsplash.

**vendor**

The fonts are downloaded from the giving source of our cource, and only two main fonts were applied in this project.

**GitHub**

**Javascript**

Based on the previous project, Javascript starts to embed in this stage. Currently, it's the stage 1 of the Sprint 4, only Arrays and Objects are being use in it for the cards so far.

DOM was primarily used in this project, like the EventListener, handlers, template, etc.

The page now start to be manipulated by the npm run dev / WEBPACK server, more mechanic now

Still has another 6 projecdts ahead/// it's time to conquer the back-end part!!!!
